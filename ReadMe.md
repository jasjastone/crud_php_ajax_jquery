## HI Noisemakers are back with something cooler ever
# This is CRUD API Modal made with jquery and ajax request
You can use the modal and modify them according to your needs but it comes with no gurantee of
getting help when you stuck or you want to change and you don't know were to start because
all of the comments are very explanatory so try to read them and understand the logic behind

# You can test the code by
my create database name called noisemakers_crude_php_ajax;
import the file from DB folder to your newly create database noisemakers_crude_php_ajax;
then copy this folder to either www or htdocs depend on your localhost server that your machine run
then go your browser and type http://localhost/crud_php_ajax/ then your all set you can now test

#### Don't forget you can find the project on github repository at any time
Use this [repository][] link will take to the project repository where you can clone it and use it or test it
## You can delete all the comments by using vscode editor shortcut press ctrl/cmd + f then press again alt+r type //.* then replace all simple as that
